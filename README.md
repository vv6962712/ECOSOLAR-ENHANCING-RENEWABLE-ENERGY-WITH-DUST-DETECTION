# ECOSOLAR-ENHANCING-RENEWABLE-ENERGY-WITH-DUST-DETECTION
Ecosolar is an advanced project focused on improving solar panel efficiency by automating dust detection with deep learning. Dust buildup can block sunlight and lower energy production; Ecosolar addresses this by leveraging the VGG16 model to classify panels as "Clean" or "Dusty" in real time. This automated system helps maximize energy output, reduce manual inspection needs, and support sustainable energy goals.

Key Features
Automated Dust Detection: Employs VGG16 CNN for high-accuracy classification, identifying dust buildup before it impacts energy production.
Real-Time Monitoring: Continuously monitors panel cleanliness, reducing the need for manual checks.
Cost Savings: Cuts maintenance costs by scheduling cleanings based on actual dust accumulation levels, enhancing efficiency.
Sustainable Energy Support: Maximizes solar output, aligning with renewable energy initiatives.
Scalable for Large Solar Farms: Suited for extensive solar installations, making it adaptable for large-scale deployments.
Data Augmentation for Accuracy: Integrates data augmentation to improve robustness and accuracy across diverse environmental conditions.
This system not only ensures optimal solar panel performance but also contributes meaningfully to the advancement of renewable energy infrastructure.
